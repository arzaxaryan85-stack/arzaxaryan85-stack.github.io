<p class="major">
<strong>Mount Ararat</strong> (5,137 m / 16,854 ft) — Symbolically significant in Armenian culture and tradition. <br>
History of Ararat
Mount Ararat is one of the most symbolic and sacred mountains in the history of mankind and especially in Armenian culture. It is located on the territory of modern Turkey, near the border with Armenia, and is the highest peak of the Armenian highlands.
<br>📍 Geography<br>
Geography
Height of Greater Ararat: 5,137 m (16,854 ft)

Little Ararat: 3,896 m

Located in eastern Turkey, Igdir Province

Located only ~30 km from the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. Visible from most points in the city.
<br>📜 Historical and cultural significance <br>1. Biblical tradition - According to the Bible (Genesis 8:4), Noah's Ark "came to rest on the mountains of Ararat" after the Great Flood.

In Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, Mount Ararat is associated with this episode.

Although the Bible does not speak of a specific mountain, but of "the mountains of Ararat", later the tradition was fixed on this peak.
<br>2. Armenian Mythology and Identity - 
Ararat is a national symbol of Armenia, despite the fact that it is located outside the modern territory of the country.

It is depicted on the coat of arms of Armenia.

In Armenian tradition, it is considered a sacred mountain, and many legends are associated with it.

❝ An Armenian may not live at the foot of Ararat, but Ararat lives in the heart of every Armenian. ❞
<br>3. History of territorial changes - 
Before the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 and especially until the 1920s, Ararat was part of the history of Armenia.

After the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the implementation of the Treaty of Kars (1921), the mountain ended up in Turkish territory.

This fact remains painful for many Armenians, and the mountain often symbolizes the lost homeland.
<br>4. Archaeology and expeditions - 
Many expeditions have tried to find the remains of the New Ark on the slopes of Ararat (especially since the 20th century).
There have been reports of wooden structures at altitude, but none of the finds have been scientifically confirmed.
<br>5. Military and strategic importance -
The area around Mount Ararat is strategically important. The border between Turkey, Armenia and Iran runs nearby.

Turkish military bases are located near the summit, and access to the mountain is limited.
<br>🎨 In culture <br>
Упоминается в тысячах армянских песен, стихов, картин, легенд.

Упоительная тема в творчестве армянских поэтов, таких как:

Ованес Туманян

Егише Чаренц

Паруйр Севак

<hr>
     <h1 class="blokimejitext">The Armenian Highland</h1><p class="major">
      is a high region at the junction of Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and Iran, covering the territories of modern Armenia, Eastern Turkey, Nakhichevan, northwestern Iran, and southern Georgia. It is one of the oldest inhabited areas of Eurasia, formed as a result of intense volcanic activity and tectonic processes.
The average altitude of the plateau is about 1,500–2,500 meters above sea level, with many extinct volcanoes, basalt plateaus, and high-mountain lakes. Its key peaks are Ararat, Aragats, Sipan, and Nemrut, and its largest lakes are Van, Sevan, and Urmia.
<br> The Armenian Highlands historically played the role of a link between Mesopotamia, Iran and Transcaucasia. It was here that some of the first agricultural cultures of the Neolithic period arose. As early as the 7th–6th millennia BC, settlements with developed forms of agriculture, cattle breeding and crafts appeared in this region.
In the following millennia, the plateau became part of the most ancient cultural areas: Chalcolithic, Early Bronze and Late Bronze civilizations. The region was distinguished by a diversity of tribes, local states and rich resource potential, including metallurgical centers. <br>
In the 9th–7th centuries BC, the kingdom of Urartu existed in the eastern part of the plateau, strengthening the system of irrigation, urban construction and state administration. This state interacted with Assyria and Media and left a rich archaeological and epigraphic heritage.
 After the collapse of Urartu, the territory of the Armenian Highlands became an arena of rivalry between various powers and local ethnic groups.
 <br>Throughout antiquity and classical times, the region was a crossroads of trade, military campaigns and cultural exchanges. Caravan routes passed through the Armenian Highlands, connecting Western Asia with the Black Sea and Caspian regions.
 At different times it was within the sphere of influence of Achaemenid Persia, the Hellenistic kingdoms, Rome, Byzantium, the Arab Caliphate, the Seljuk and Ottoman Empires, and the Russian Empire.
 <br>Despite the change of ruling empires, the Armenian Highland retained its cultural and geopolitical integrity thanks to its landscape, which created stable regional structures and forms of life. It was its mountainous isolation and natural features that contributed to the development of local cultures, crafts, writing and religious traditions. <br>
 By the beginning of the 20th century, a significant part of the Armenian Highlands was part of the Ottoman and Persian empires, and later Turkey, Iran and the USSR. As a result of wars, genocide, migrations and resettlements, the ethnic and cultural appearance of the region changed significantly, but its historical significance as one of the centers of the ancient world and natural and cultural landscape remains to this day.
 <br>Today, the Armenian Highland is a unique geographical and historical-cultural region with a rich archaeological heritage, landscape diversity and a multi-thousand-year history that is important not only for the peoples of the Caucasus and the Middle East, but also for the entire world civilization.

  <p class="blokimejitext">The Orontids were initially satraps (governors) under the Median and Achaemenid empires, but over time they gained semi-independence and eventually full kingship, especially after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC.
 <br><br><strong>🧿 Origins and Role</strong> <br>
The Orontids were of either Iranian (Median) or Armenian nobility origin, closely connected to the Achaemenid royal family.

Their rule marked the beginning of Armenian statehood.

They founded major political centers like Erebuni (modern Yerevan), Armavir, and later Yerazgavors.

They ruled over Armenia, Sophene (Tzopk), and Commagene, depending on the period.
<br>🧱 Key Rulers of the Orontid Dynasty  <br>
Note: Records from this era are fragmentary, so some dates and names may vary among sources. <br>
⚖️ Legacy of the Orontids <br>
First to unify parts of historic Armenia under a native dynasty.

Maintained Armenian identity under Persian and later Macedonian rule.

Their era saw the foundation of key cities and early forms of Armenian aristocracy.

The later Kings of Commagene (a Greco-Iranian kingdom) also claimed descent from the Orontids.
<br><br>🛑End of the Orontid Dynasty – c. 200 BC <br>
Around 201–200 BC, the Orontid line was overthrown by Artashes I, the founder of the Artashesid (Artaxiad) dynasty.

Artashes established a stronger, centralized Armenian kingdom with Hellenistic influence and minted Armenian coins.

<br><strong>🕊️ Historical Background</strong><br>
After the fall of the Bagratuni Kingdom in 1045 and the Seljuk invasion (Battle of Manzikert, 1071), many Armenian nobles and people migrated to Cilicia.

Ruben I, a noble claiming descent from the Bagratids, established a mountain stronghold and gradually expanded Armenian authority.

The Rubinians built alliances with Crusader states, Byzantium, and later Western Europe.

By the late 12th century, under Leo II, Cilicia was recognized as a regional Christian power.
<br><br><strong>🔚 End of the Rubinian Dynasty (as ruling line)</strong><br>
In 1198, Leo II was crowned King Leo I, marking the transition from prince to king and the beginning of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.

The Rubinians continued as kings until the Hethumid Dynasty took power in 1252 through dynastic marriage.
<br><br><strong>🏛️ Legacy of the Rubinians</strong><br>
Founders of Cilician Armenian independence, diplomacy, and kingship.

Established alliances with Crusaders, the Papacy, and Europe.

Defended Christian Armenia in a hostile Islamic and Byzantine frontier.

Helped preserve Armenian culture, literature, and autonomy during the Middle Ages.

  <h3 class="blokimejitext">🛑 1375 – Fall of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia</h3><p class="blokimejitext">King Levon VI (Leo V) Lusignan was the last reigning king. After his capture by the Mamluks, the Armenian monarchy ceased to exist as a sovereign state.
    However, titular claims to the Armenian crown were carried on by the Lusignan kings of Cyprus, then by the House of Savoy and others.
  </p> 
<h3 class="blokimejitext"> 👑 Titular “Kings of Armenia” (1375–20th century)</h3>
 <p class="blokimejitext"> <strong>⚜️ Lusignan Dynasty (Cyprus branch)</strong><br>After 1375, the Kings of Cyprus (Lusignans) continued to style themselves as “King of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia.”
James I of Cyprus	d. 1398	Nephew of Leo V; claimed title after Leo’s death.
Successive Lusignan kings of Cyprus	14th–15th centuries	Continued using “King of Armenia” in official titles.
<br><strong>🇮🇹 House of Savoy</strong><br>In 1485, after Lusignan extinction, the House of Savoy inherited the titular claim through Charlotte of Cyprus, last queen of the Lusignan line.

Savoy rulers (later Kings of Italy) used the title until the 20th century:

Victor Emmanuel II (first king of unified Italy)

Victor Emmanuel III

Umberto II (last King of Italy, until 1946) <br>⚠️ These titles were ceremonial and symbolic, with no control over Armenian lands.
<br><br><strong>🏛️ Armenian Leadership After the Kingdom (non-royal rule) <br>
🕊️ Diaspora Leadership (14th–19th c.)</strong>Armenia fragmented into:

Persian Armenia (Safavid Empire)

Ottoman Armenia

Russian Armenia

Armenian meliks (princes) ruled small autonomous regions in Karabakh (Melikdoms).

The Catholicos of the Armenian Church became the spiritual and de facto national leader of the Armenians.

The Armenian Church remained independent from Byzantium and Rome, rejecting the Chalcedon Cathedral (451).

Armenia and the church were closely related: the church preserved culture, language and traditions under foreign rule (Arabs, Seljuks, Mongols, Turks).

Outstanding monasteries were built: Sevanavank, Tatev, Gegard, Khor Virap.

<br> <details><summary>genocide</summary>
 <h3 class="blokimejitext">The Armenian Genocide was the systematic extermination of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923. This tragic event is recognized by many countries and historians as genocide, that is, the deliberate extermination of an entire people.</h3> <p class="blokimejitext">What happened? <br>
Since 1915 (during World War I), the Ottoman government, especially the Young Turks, began mass deportations and killings of Armenians.

At first, Armenian leaders, intellectuals, and men of military age were arrested and killed.
Then hundreds of thousands of women, children and old people were forcibly sent to the Syrian desert - in conditions where it was almost impossible to survive (death marches).

According to various estimates, between 800 thousand and 1.5 million Armenians died.
<br>The reasons were complex and multi-level:<br>Nationalism and the Fear of Empire Disintegration
The Ottoman Empire was multinational, but by the early 20th century Turkish nationalism was on the rise. Armenians, as a Christian minority, were suspected of disloyalty. <br>Wartime and the Fear of the "Internal Enemy"
During World War I, the Ottoman Empire fought against Russia. Some Armenians actually fought on the side of the Russian Empire. This became a pretext for declaring all Armenians potential "traitors." <br>The idea of "Turkization"
The Young Turks wanted to create a single Turkic state - without Christians and "foreigners". Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians fell into this category. <br>Consequences<br>
The Armenians were almost completely exterminated in historical Western Armenia (present-day Eastern Turkey).

Those who survived scattered around the world, creating the Armenian Diaspora.

Turkey still does not officially recognize the genocide, which remains a source of international conflict and pain for Armenians around the world.
